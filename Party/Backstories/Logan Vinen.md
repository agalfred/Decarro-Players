Dominic and Rachel Vinen had gave birth to their first born Logan in [[Vrisa]]. After a few years and their daughter Jane was born, they moved to the port city of [[Rothsven]]. It was here that Logan and his siblings would be raised. Logan adapted well to the port city life that Rothsven had to offer. 

While Logan and his younger brother Kain would wander around town they met the friendship of [[Rhett Windroot]]. Rhett and Logan quickly became best friends and the three of them would do basically everything together growing up. That was until [[Blight]] managed to make its way to Rothsven. 

"Kain is gone" Logan said in a soft and reluctant voice. His lip quivered, body shaking, face flushed pale and eyes tearing as he could not compose himself.

Rhett found opportunity down at the docks and on the [[Bursmond Sea]] sailing, while Logan found himself assisting his father in his work. Logan and his father Dominic would travel around finding and recovering artifacts. While traveling with his father, Logan met a beautiful elf woman named (Insert name here) and instantly fell in love. She was a traveling merchant and had business all over the world, meaning Logan does not see her often. He lives for the small moments that he does get with her. 

While traveling with his father Logan met [[Doran Ellendrel]] in passing while purchasing paintings from Doran's mothers shop.
