As a wanderer of both [[The Glaciated]] and [[The Line]], even when Buck found himself with very little nature would provide. He travelled in caravans with his family and their herd of reindeer. They held a special connection to those beasts, they were like family. Although their clan was self-sufficient on the cold side it was not uncommon for them to travel back to the middle for tools and equipment they didn’t have the skill or resources to craft. They always kept some coins saved to pay [[The Silent Force]] for safe passage through their tunnels between ‘worlds’. Buck hated those dark tunnels. He could handle the bitter cold of the dark side, but that dank choking air of [[The Pathways]]? That was a struggle for him.

"When you live in a world of darkness surrounded by only the harsh cold what do you do? Do you let its frozen bite turn your soul into a liches heart or do you recognize every home needs its hearth? Despite everything I am an optimist, I do not let the dreary dark creep into the boundaries of my mind." - Buck'Kieles

Buck met his wife Helga while harvesting wood along The Line. She was hurt and he saved her. He was captivated by her stoutness and hardy frame. She was the kind of woman that could break you in half and he admired that about her. Unfortunately, it was his heart that she broke. It wasn’t all for not though, as they spent two beautiful years together. It was during this time that Buck met [[Logan Vinen]], who eventually became a stalwart friend and ally.  
  
Being far away from his family felt strange. Buck had never travelled without them before. He booked passage on a ship to a place called [[Rothsven]]. Luckily, he met a friend-of-a-friend, [[Rhett Windroot]] is his name.  
  
When Rothsven was under attack by a giant serpent every man, woman, and child seemed to adorn the robes of Bucks clan or the antlers of his herd. He was willing to bleed, break and even die for these ill-scented strangers. It was like something had taken over in that moment. He didn’t want to be a hero, he only wanted to get back home to his Mother and Father. Unfortunately, the giant serpent struck Buck worse than he could have expected. His ankle shattered and presumably left to die from the venomous bite. As his heartbeat grew faint and breathing labored, he begged for something, anything to help him. In his darkest moment, he was met by a force even darker. He was offered strength, survival, and an abundance of power. He offered ‘Anything’ to survive this onslaught and protect these people. He survived, making a pact he knew nothing of. He now rides to [[Elmwood]] with his new friends, to seek out what put him on this path.
