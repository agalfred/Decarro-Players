an enemy of hers hold a severe grudge

Kaelen Ardyn Ellisar was born into a family whose legacy was both a blessing and a curse. Her human mother, Mariel “Stormhelm” Ellisar, was a legendary sailor—known as the only female captain to successfully navigate the three seas. Her name was whispered in awe in across villages and cities alike, though her fame brought with it scrutiny and expectations. Retiring after her daughter and Kaelen's twin Kaera was executed, Mariel became a dock worker in a rundown village, struggling to find peace in a simpler life.

Kaelen’s father, Therion Ellisar, was an elven priest devoted to preserving balance in a world torn apart bringing forward [[The End Times]]. His calm demeanor and reverence for the divine offered a counterpoint to Mariel’s fiery spirit, but his idealism often clashed with the practical realities of survival in the Line’s harsh twilight.

Therion and Mariel had their eldest Garrin in a small village in the [[Forest of Ellaren]]. Therion was met with exceeding predjudice for being intimate with a human. Mariel however was having none of that and held her ground. Shortly after Rowen's birth, Mariel began her sailing career out of the port at [[Rothsven]] and thus the family moved into the town. After Garrin became of proper age to watch over his siblings, Therion began roaming back into the Forest of Ellaren to study among the elven clerics. 

Kaelen grew up in a cramped, crumbling apartment, one of six siblings. Each of them bore the weight of their parents’ legacies in different ways.

Kaelen’s childhood was marked by isolation. Her quiet, introspective nature set her apart, and the village saw her as strange. Her only solace came from her twin, Kaera, and her childhood friend, [[Doran Ellendrel]]. Together, they explored the [[Forest of Ellaren]] and ruins, dreaming of adventure and greatness.

Kaelen’s path toward the shadows began with a moment of fire and blood. While scavenging remote Ellaren village, Kaelen encountered a drunken scavenger who mistook her quiet demeanor for weakness. When his unwanted physical advances turned violent, Kaelen lashed out in self-defense, killing him with a nearby tool. Though her actions were justified, the man’s family sought vengeance, and Kaelen became the target of their wrath.

Her twin, Kaera, stepped forward and claimed responsibility to protect her. Kaera’s selflessness was both her greatest strength and her undoing. Despite Kaelen’s protests, Kaera accepted the punishment of execution, believing her sacrifice would preserve the family and spare Kaelen from a life of condemnation.

Kaera’s death fractured the Ellisar family. Garrin, the eldest, buried himself in work, striving to hold the family together despite his grief. Rowen, ever practical, turned cold toward Kaelen, seeing her as the cause of the family’s misfortune. Sylric, already estranged, used the tragedy as a reason to sever ties completely. Thalor, too young to fully understand the truth, grew up harboring doubts about Kaelen’s role in the event, torn between love and suspicion. After the death of Kaera and Mariel's retirement, the family moved to a small village just outside of Rothsven. 

For Kaelen, Kaera’s death became a scar she could not heal. Wracked with guilt and grief, she disconnected from her family. She abandoned dreams of glory like her mother and turned instead to survival, navigating the wilderness and ruins on the edges of the Zones honing her skills.

While visiting Rothsven one day to get a drink and catch up with close friend Doran, the city was attacked by a giant serpent. When faced with the beast, Kaelen scoured whatever she could to arm herself against the beast. She found herself a sling and began launching projectiles at the serpent. It was an oddly natural feeling, attacking from range while sticking to the shadows. The serpent retreated offshore to a boat and Kaelen found herself surrounded by a group of people who cared for each other and their safety. She marched with this group on their adventure to [[Elmwood]] to find more information about the [[Hooded Figure]] that seems to have sent the serpent to Rothsven. 

Although she has found a group of people who care for her, she still longs to atone for her sister's wrongful death and searches the world for a way to bring her back.
