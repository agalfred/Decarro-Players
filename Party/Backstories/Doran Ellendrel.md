Doran Ellendrel was born in the [[Forest of Ellaren]], a beautiful stretch of towering oaks and evergreens not often seen even along [[The Line]]. This forest was inhabited mostly by a large society of elves that lived with nature and helped to protect the forest from those who would wish it ill. Alas, Doran was not fated to remain among the elves as he was born of a human mother. His father, Doadren Ellendrel was amongst the higher caste of elves, serving as a guardian of the forest, a position of high prestige. Alas, he made the mistake of falling in love with a human woman. Doadren knew that such love was forbidden, and even knowing that the lives of humans were fleeting, their love bore a child. 

Doran’s mother Amara, who lived in hiding in the forest protected by Doadren, was eventually discovered just after Doran had been born. Once it was found out by the Elves that Doadren was intimate with a human, Doadren knew it was only a matter of time before they came for Doran. With haste, Doadren brought Amara and the newly born Doran to an escape route along a small creek and got them out of the forest safely. Doadren stayed behind to help keep the others at bay and protect his family. To this day, neither Amara nor Doran know of Doadren’s fate.

After escaping from the forest of Ellaren, Amara eventually found passage among a group of merchants. Their destination, [[Rothsven]]. Over the next several years living in Rothsven, her talent as a jeweler became apparent from her eye-catching pieces that she would create. She found stable work and eventually married a man named Madok, a priest who followed the teachings of [[Vurdon]]. With Madok, Amara had three more children, the oldest named Marik, who was an initiate of Vurdon. Marik dislikes Doran as he sees him as a person who undermines his father. The second oldest named Jax, very much likes Doran, but has a propensity to gamble his money away he earns from being a laborer. Finally, the youngest named Mello, became a soldier several years ago and in a conflict with beasts in the forest, went missing after fighting the unknown beasts and was never found. 

Doran’s life in Rothsven is one of doing odd jobs, and following Madok to learn teachings of Vurdon when his step father drags him into it. Doran doesn’t like the structured way of life, and feels that the teaching of Vurdon is constricting, just like his stepfather. Every day sitting in the lecture hall of the church, he would stare out the window hoping for adventure, but it never found him. Until the day when everything changed.

Whilst running to save his mother from the terror that the giant serpent beast caused, he found her unresponsive and hurt. When he had no one to turn to, no one to help, he did not look towards someone else like the guards, his stepfather or even the supposedly all-powerful Vurdon. Doran looked inside himself, and brought forth his own power. Centering himself and calling upon his own ki to give him strength, he brought his mother and himself out of a life threatening situation.

Now with this newfound strength and understanding of the self that Doran has acquired, he knows that adventure is calling to him. The days of sitting in a lecture hall are over. The time to use his strength for the good of all who walk The Line, has come. He now rides to [[Elmwood]] with his new friends, to seek out what put him on this path.
